     In summary, the purpose of these interfaces is to provide a clear definition of the objects and their properties/methods used in the Google Sign-In process, ensuring type safety, documentation, and consistency during development. The actual implementation of the Google authentication API would involve using these interfaces as a reference while writing the code that interacts with the Google Sign-In library or SDK.
